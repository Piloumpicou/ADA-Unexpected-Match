    "<br>Although it is not listed in the proposed datasets, this dataset is strongly linked to the MSD, since it contains descriptions to the lyrics related to the MSD songs (roughly 779K songs covered).\n",
    "The lyrics are provided as a bag of stemmed words, with the top words per song. One of the main reason behind this representation choice is that the official lyrics are copyright protected.\n",

    "- The Echo Nest **Taste Profile Subset**\n",
    "<br >This dataset is linked to the first one as well. It provides triplets of [user - song - play count]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- R2 - **Yahoo! Music User Ratings** of Songs with Artist, Album, and Genre Meta Information, v. 1.0\n",
    "<br>This dataset can be obtain on demand for a research purpose only. It could be very useful to integrate the ratings of songs in our data. \n",
