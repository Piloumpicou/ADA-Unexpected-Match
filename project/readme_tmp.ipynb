Since we are not yet worldwise well-known artists, we will need to work mostly on \"unknow\" artists having produced popular songs. *(does this make sense...?)* -> like Despacito. LoL\n",

    "The lyrics are provided as a bag of stemmed words, with the top words per song. One of the main reason behind this representation choice is that the official lyrics are copyright protected.\n",

    "- The Echo Nest **Taste Profile Subset**\n",
    "<br >This dataset is linked to the first one as well. It provides triplets of [user - song - play count]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- R2 - **Yahoo! Music User Ratings** of Songs with Artist, Album, and Genre Meta Information, v. 1.0\n",
    "<br>This dataset can be obtain on demand for a research purpose only. It could be very useful to integrate the ratings of songs in our data. \n",
